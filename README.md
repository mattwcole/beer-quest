# Beer Quest

Demo .NET 5 API with React static front end that displays a list of pubs in Leeds.

## Running

Apps may be run natively or in production mode with Docker.

### Docker

Run `docker-compose up` from the root of the repository. This will run tests and build/run containers for both apps. Browse the web app at http://localhost:8080. The API has a single endpoint at http://localhost:8081/pubs.

### API

- `dotnet run -p BeerQuestApi` - run API
- `dotnet test` - run integration tests

Minimal API with source in a single file. Example integration tests spin up the API in memory. Test data currently coupled to csv file used by the API.
